### Hello, I'm Pavel Klochkov 
I have more than 10 years of web development experience. 

My main scope is Frontend, where I'm focused on architecture, clean, and performant code. I have experience with different app structures solutions: monolith, modular, serverless in on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. 

I'm highly motivated, open-minded, goal-oriented. I keen on IT-transformation and cloud technologies.
